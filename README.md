# vscode-naming-rules



The Naming Conventions Extension for VS Code allows you to define naming conventions for your project and then check if the names of your files and folders are compliant with the defined conventions.

It looks for both files and folders in the workspace and checks if the names are compliant with the defined conventions defined in the `.namingrc.json` file.  It also provides JSON schema support for the `.namingrc.json` file.

## Features

<img src="assets/naming-rules-demo.gif" alt="Demo of the naming rules extension" />

- Define naming conventions for your project
- Save the rules in a proect specific `.namingrc.json` file
- Check if the names of your files and folders are compliant with the defined conventions
- JSON schema support for the `.namingrc.json` file

Rules defined in the `.namingrc.json` are in JSON format and can be defined as follows:

```json
{
    "rules": [
         {
            "type": "extension_not_allowed",
            "includes": "webroot/**/*.php",
            "severity": 1,
            "message": "Extension [*.php] Not allowed under webroot/ because PHP sucks",
            "href": "https://markdrew.io/docs/why_no_php_in_webroot.html"
        },
    ]
}
```
## Writing your own rules 

In the .namingrc.json file you can define your own rules. The rules are defined as an array of rule objects in JSON.

Each rule object needs the following properties:

- `type`: The type of rule.  We support the following types:
    - `extension_not_allowed`: Disallow files with a specific extension.  For example, disallowing `.php` files in the `webroot` folder.
    - `folder_not_allowed`: Disallow folders within the inclddes, for example, putting `tests` in the webroot folder.
    - `filename_postfix`: Require files with a specific postfix (or suffix).  For example, all `js` files in the test folder should end with `test.js`.
    - `regex`: Find content in files that matches the regex. Good for security checking, making sure passwords for example are not in code etc. 
    - `tag`: Find tags in the content of a file. For example make sure that we are not using the `marquee` tag in our code!
    - `function`: Find functions in the content of a file. For example make sure that we are not using the `eval` function in our code.

- `includes`: A glob pattern that defines the files or folders that the rule applies to.  For example `webroot/**/*.php` would apply the rule to all PHP files under the webroot folder.
- `severity`: The severity of the rule. These are:
    - `1` - Error
    - `2` - Warning
    - `3` - Information
    - `4` - Hint
- `message`: The message to display when the rule is violated

Optionally you can also include the following properties:

- `href`: A URL to a page that explains the rule in more detail
- `excludes`: A glob pattern that defines the files or folders that the rule does not apply to.  For example `webroot/**/readme.md` would not match files if you have `includes` of `webroot/**/*.md` but you want to exclude `readme.md` files.


### Example Rules:
####  Disallow Markdown Files in webroot

```
 {
    "type": "extension_not_allowed",
    "includes": "webroot/**/*.md",
    "severity": 1,
    "message": "Extension [*.md] Not allowed under webroot/ as it can show sensitive information.",
    "href": "https://example.com/docs/no-markdown-in-webroot.html"
},
```
This rule prevents markdown files (files ending with `.md`) from residing anywhere within the `webroot` directory. Markdown files in this location may unintentionally expose sensitive documentation or configuration details.

#### Dont allow specifc tags in certian files

```
{
    "type": "tag",
    "includes": "webroot/**/*.html",
    "severity": 1,
    "message": "The <marquee> tag is not allowed in webroot HTML files.",
    "href": "https://example.com/docs/no-marquee-tag.html"
}
```
This rule prevents the use of the `<marquee>` tag in HTML files within the `webroot` directory. The `<marquee>` tag is considered a deprecated and non-standard HTML element that should not be used in modern web development.


#### Dont allow specific functions in certian files

```
{
    "type": "function",
    "includes": "webroot/**/*.js",
    "severity": 1,
    "message": "The eval() function is not allowed in webroot JavaScript files.",
    "href": "https://example.com/docs/no-eval-function.html"
}
```
This rule prevents the use of the `eval()` function in JavaScript files within the `webroot` directory. The `eval()` function is considered a security risk and should be avoided in modern web development.

#### Dont allow folders in certian places

```
{
    "type": "folder_not_allowed",
    "includes": "webroot/**/tests",
    "severity": 1,
    "message": "Folder [tests] not allowed under [webroot/] as it can show sensitive information.",
    "href": "https:/example.com/tests-in-webroot.html"
}
```

This rule checks for folders that should not be there, for example `tests` folders under the `webroot` folder. This is because tests can expose sensitive information about your application.

#### Check for the postfix (or suffix) of test files
```
{
    "type": "filename_postfix",
    "excludes": "DataProvider.js",
    "includes": "unit_tests/**/*.js",
    "value": ".test",
    "severity": 3,
    "message": "Unit tests should end with <SomeComponent>.test.js",
    "href": "https:/example.com/add-test-postfix.html"
}
```
The rule above looks for all files that are in the `unit_tests` folder and checks if they end with `.test`. SO for example all javascript files like `somecomponent.js` but if it doesnt have `.test` at the end it will show an information message.

#### Check for a regex in the content of a file
```
{
    "type": "regex",
    "includes": "webroot/**/*.js",
    "value": "(?i)(password|passwd|pwd|secret|api[-_]?key)\s*[=:]\s*["']([^"']{8,})["']",
    "severity": 1,
    "message": "Do not add secrets or api passwords int your code",
    "href": "https://example.com/docs/no-secrets-in-code.html"
}
```

The `regex` type of rule allows you to put any regex in the `value` field and it will check the content of the file for that regex. This is useful for checking for security issues, for example, passwords in code.
Node: The above regex is just  simple example, you should use a more complex regex for your own code
